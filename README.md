# Tinker

Tinker is a code-sharing tool for the web.

## About this repository

This repository includes everything you need to get an instance of Tinker
running on your own server. It just has submodules to the existing sub-project,
but allows for a very easy install by just cloning one repository rather than
several different ones.

Secondary purpose of this repository is to offer a centralised place to collect
issues. Since Tinker is split up into 4 separate repositories now, it could
potentially be hard for an end-user to know where to report bugs and such, this
repository aims to solve that issue.

## Installation

```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/tinker/tinker.git
```

When things are a little bit further along, this repository will get a handy
installation script so you don't have to go into each subdirectory to `npm
install`, but for now, this will do.
